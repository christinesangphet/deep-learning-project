## Modeling 
This folder contains notebooks for training and tuning neural network models to classify song lyrics, as well as testing their performance. Below is a brief description of each notebook included in this folder:

#### Descriptions

- **mood_prediction_NN_v1**: Implemented a feedforward neural network to classify music lyrics based on topics to provide a baseline model for prediction.
- **mood_prediction_NN_v2**: Fine-tuned the feedforward neural network model by adjusting hyperparameters and using pre-trained layers to enhance performance.
- **mood_prediction_NN_v3**:
