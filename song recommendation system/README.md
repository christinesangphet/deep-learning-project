## Song Recommendation System
This folder contains a notebook that recommends songs based on the user's mood and preferences, utilizing Gradio for interactive user input. The system uses the Fine-Tuned Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) model, which achieved the best accuracy, to generate suggestions. Users can select a mood or topic, and the system provides up to ten random songs matching that topic. The system processes the song lyrics, applies a confidence threshold to select appropriate songs, and falls back on the topic if there arenâ€™t enough confident songs available.
